NAME

    Geo::Ellipsoid - longitude and latitude calculations using an ellipsoid
    model

Methods are now guaranteed to return angle values in the range [0,2pi) or
[-pi,pi). The output range may be selected with arguments to the new()
constructor method or by calling the set_longitude_symmetric or
set_bearing_symmetric methods.

Perls older than 5.6 are not supported.

This module is a port of existing Fortran subroutines to Perl.
